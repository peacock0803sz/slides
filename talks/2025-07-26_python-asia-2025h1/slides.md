# Why I Keep Organizing Tech Events<br />(Hint: It's Fun!)

## Lessons from a PyCon JP Organizer

### Peacock (Yoichi Takai)<br />2025-07-26 PythonAsia Online Charity Talk H1 2025

<!--
Hello everyone! I'm Peacock, and today I want to share with you why I think organizing tech events is one of the most rewarding experiences in our community. This is a topic very close to my heart, and I hope my story will inspire some of you to get involved in event management.
-->

# Today's Target Audiences

I hope this resonates with people who:

- Are interested in or want to start event management/organizing
- Have managed events but couldn't keep it going
- Want to learn about tech events/conferences in general

## Topics NOT Covered

- Organizational theory in volunteer teams
- Know-how for online/hybrid events

<!--
Before we dive in, let me clarify who this talk is for. If you've ever been curious about what goes on behind the scenes at tech events, or if you've tried organizing but found it challenging to continue, this talk is for you. I won't be covering organizational theory or online event specifics - instead, I'll focus on the personal, human side of event management.

<!--
Here's my main message today - and I really want to emphasize this - organizing tech events is FUN! Yes, it's work, yes it can be challenging, but the joy and satisfaction you get from it is incredible. Let me share my journey with you.

# Why I contribute to PyCon JP continuously?

<!--
So you might wonder, why have I been doing this for over 5 years? What keeps me coming back year after year? Let me take you back to where it all started.
-->

---

# How I got started contribution?

First-time attended at PyCon JP 2019, I was so excited,<br />and posted interesting to organize PyCon JP <twemoji-eyes />

<img src="/tweet-1173885943821955074.png" width="512" />

<!--
I've loved organizing events since my student days - school festivals and such. When I moved to Tokyo and attended PyCon JP 2019 for the first time, I was blown away. The energy, the community, the learning - it was all so inspiring. So naturally, I tweeted "Event organizing looks interesting!" - and that simple tweet changed everything.
-->

---

# \!?\!? It's time to join...

<img src="/tweet-1173888748523675650.png" width="512" />

<!--
And then something unexpected happened! Takanory-san, one of the PyCon JP organizers, liked my tweet. I thought "Well, now I have to do it!" So I checked the "interested in organizing" to the participant survey, and a few days later, I received the volunteer application form. Sometimes opportunities come from the most unexpected places!

<!--
But I don't just organize - I also participate as a speaker. This dual perspective has been invaluable. When you've been on both sides, you understand what speakers need, what attendees expect, and how to create that perfect conference experience. Speaking at international conferences has also shown me how different communities approach events.
-->

# My Motivation Comes from Participant Feedback

- It was fun!
- Please do it again next year!
- I'll participate again next year!

The organizing period is tough,<br>but hearing these voices after the event makes me want to do it again

-> **The PDCA cycle keeps spinning**

<!--
So what keeps me going? It's the feedback. When someone tells me "It was fun!" or "Please do it again next year!" - that makes all the late nights and stress worth it. Yes, organizing is tough. There are moments when you question why you're doing this. But then the event happens, people connect, learn, and grow together, and you remember exactly why. This positive feedback creates a cycle - Plan, Do, Check, Act - that keeps improving our events year after year.

# What I Value

<!--
Through these experiences, I've developed some core values and principles that I believe are essential for sustainable event management. Let me share three key insights.
-->

---

# Beginners also Can Organize Events

- You don't need to be an expert in the technology
- If speaking rights are biased toward experts, it won't last long (citation needed)
- Rather, organize with the mindset of "I don't know, please teach me"

<!--
First and most importantly - you don't need to be an expert to organize events! In fact, I believe beginners make some of the best organizers. Why? Because you remember what it's like to be new, to feel lost, to need guidance. When only experts run events, they can become exclusive and intimidating. The best approach is to say "I don't know much about this, but I want to learn and help others learn too."
-->

---

# Don't Push Yourself Too Hard

- Burnout syndrome in OSS [^1]
    - This applies to event management too
    - A state where you're too exhausted after the event to continue
- Always have backup plans [^2]
    - Think about the bare minimum, take breaks, find core teammates

[^1]: https://opensource.guide/ja/maintaining-balance-for-open-source-maintainers/
[^2]: https://slides.com/codemickeycode/pythonph-one-does-not-simply#/32

<!--
Second, and this is crucial - don't burn yourself out. There's a real phenomenon called burnout syndrome in open source, and it absolutely applies to event organizing. I've seen too many passionate organizers push themselves so hard for one perfect event that they never want to organize again. Always have backup plans, know your minimum viable event, take breaks, and build a strong core team. Sustainability is more important than perfection.
-->

---

# Don't Try to Do Everything Alone

- Create an environment where you can consult and discuss when troubled
- **Share the work with teammates (ideally 3 people total)**
    - With just 2 people, it can be hard to resolve disagreements

<!--
Third, never try to do everything alone. Event organizing is a team sport. You need people to bounce ideas off, to share the workload, to support each other when things get tough. I've found that three people is the magic number for a core team - with two people, disagreements can become deadlocks, but with three, you can always find a path forward. Create an environment where everyone feels safe to ask questions and share concerns.
-->

---

# Summary: Community Management is Fun!

- **Tech event management is a fun activity**
- Participant feedback is the source of motivation
- Important mindsets for management:
    - You don't need to be an expert in the language/technology
    - Don't try to do everything alone, find teammates
    - Not overdoing it is key to sustainability

<!--
So let me wrap up. Tech event management is genuinely fun and rewarding. Yes, it's work, but it's work that brings communities together, helps people grow, and creates lasting memories. Remember - you don't need to be an expert, you don't need to do it alone, and you don't need to sacrifice your well-being. Start small, find your team, and enjoy the journey.
